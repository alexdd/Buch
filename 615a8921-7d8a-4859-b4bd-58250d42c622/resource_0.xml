document analysis, and many academic and commercial approaches have been developed to recognize tables in several
document formats, including plain text, scanned page images
and born-digital, object-based formats such as PDF. Despite the
abundance of these techniques, an objective comparison of their
performance is still missing. The Table Competition held in
the context of ICDAR 2013 is our first attempt at objectively
evaluating these techniques against each other in a standardized
way, across several input formats. The competition independently
addresses three problems: (i) table location, (ii) table structure
recognition, and (iii) these two tasks combined. We received
results from seven academic systems, which we have also compared against four commercial products. This paper presents our
findings</p></body></topic>
